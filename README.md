Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis
Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Zomato restaurant listings. The goal is to extract useful business insights and trends from restaurant and cuisine data collected across multiple countries. By analyzing features like ratings, cuisines, and price ranges, the analysis uncovers patterns that can inform restaurant owners, food enthusiasts, and businesses.

Dataset Description

The analysis uses two datasets:

zomato.csv – A comprehensive dataset of Zomato restaurant information, including fields such as Restaurant Name, City, Locality, Cuisines, Average Cost for Two, Currency, Table Booking Availability, Online Delivery, Price Range, Ratings, and Votes.

Country-Code.xlsx – A reference table mapping numeric country codes to country names, allowing interpretation of country-specific insights.

Together, these datasets cover restaurant data from multiple countries, enabling comparisons of culinary trends and rating distributions globally.

Key Features

The analysis highlights several interesting findings, such as:

Top Cuisines: Identify the most popular and highest-rated cuisines overall and within each country.

Country-wise Ratings: Compare average restaurant ratings across different countries to spot regional differences in customer satisfaction.

Location Insights: Highlight top cities or localities with the highest number of restaurants and highest average ratings.

Price vs. Rating: Explore the relationship between price range (average cost for two) and restaurant ratings.

Delivery & Booking Trends: Analyze how online delivery and table booking availability relate to restaurant popularity.

These features help illustrate key trends and business insights drawn from the Zomato data.

Technologies Used

Python 3 – Programming language for data analysis.

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis.
